An object orientation representation tool that I fabricated using multiple free sources. This processing code is a live 3D box plot of orientation of an accelerometer+gyroscope board. The processing file GRT is an openSource code

1) Sends data to and from the Gesture Recognition Toolbox, to gain state prediction.
2) Also sends data to max through OSC for manipulation. In this case, a sample trigger.
3) Sends data to an Arduino board as well, through serial port.
